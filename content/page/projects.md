This is the place for the projects like example applications, scripts, showcases etc.

### Web Terminal 
This simple app is based on Spring Boot 3, web sockets, and JSch ssh2 java library ( http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/). The goal is to demonstrate these things working together, as well as the usecase: reaching out to the remote server via ssh from a web browser, with no efforts.
