Hi there, I'm Anton and I am have been working with computer related stuff for more than 15 years.

My current interests are full-stack development, operating systems, cloud native solutions and virtualization. I play around mostly with Java and JavaScript, however, recently I have started looking into Rust and Go ;)

As for the operating systems I am inclined mostly towards Linux distributions since experimenting with them gives unlimited opportunities to learn new things. I spent lots of hours configuring and compiling Gentoo, playing with Arch, and ... building LFS (not finished yet though). Today my everyday distro of choice is Fedora 38.

All the articles on this site is the result of my learning and experience. I may assume that the posts may contain some flaws and some may not seemed detailed. It's fine, the goal is just to collect brief information for those who look for the quick answers for the questions. Anyway, please feel free to contact me if you have any notes.

My spare time is mostly devoted to playing guitar, games (video games as well) with my son.
